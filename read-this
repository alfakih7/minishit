hears how i imagne the data structure will go like
t_struct *tokens = ///splited by pipes
	int number of pipes
	t_struct *commands //// this point to the first command in the linked list of commands
	struct s_tokens	*next /// points to the next command

t_struct *commands =
	char **cmd /////this will be the command that goes into the execve including its arguments
	t_struct *redirection ///////this wil point to the first redirectio in the linked list of redierections

t_struct *redirection
	int type
	char *file_name
	struct s_redirection	*next ////////points to the next command
